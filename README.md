# musicplayerproject This code implements a Playlist Manager using a singly linked list to manage a collection of songs. The SongNode class represents each song, storing its title and a pointer to the next song. The Playlist class provides core functionality: adding songs to the end of the playlist, displaying all songs in order, shuffling the playlist using random.shuffle(), playing and removing the next song, and removing a specific song by title. The program efficiently handles dynamic operations like insertion, deletion, and reordering, making it a practical solution for managing a playlist.
